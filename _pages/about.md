I am a Computer Science PhD student at the [Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). Before starting my PhD, I completed by Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a special focus on adversarial attacks and defenses. Specifically, I investigate how malicious actors might exploit vulnerabilities in search and generative AI systems, and I develop methods to make these systems more robust.
